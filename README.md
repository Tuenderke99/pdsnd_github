### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project is an interactive Python script that allows users to explore bikeshare data from three major cities in the United States: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. The script takes user input to filter the data and compute descriptive statistics. Users can choose to filter the data by **city**, **month**, and **day of the week**.

1. `bikeshare.py` - Python script for exploring bikeshare data
2. `chicago.csv` - Bikeshare data for the city of Chicago
3. `new_york_city.csv` - Bikeshare data for the city of New York
4. `washington.csv`v - Bikeshare data for the city of Washington
5. `README.md` - This file, containing information about the project
