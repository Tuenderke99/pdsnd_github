### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project is an interactive Python script that allows users to explore bikeshare data from three major cities in the United States: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. The script takes user input to filter the data and compute descriptive statistics. Users can choose to filter the data by **city**, **month**, and **day of the week**.

### Files used
The following files are used in this project:

1. `bikeshare.py` - Python script for exploring bikeshare data
2. `chicago.csv` - Bikeshare data for the city of Chicago
3. `new_york_city.csv` - Bikeshare data for the city of New York
4. `washington.csv`v - Bikeshare data for the city of Washington
5. `README.md` - This file, containing information about the project

### Dependencies
Before running the script, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

+ Python 3.x
+ Pandas
+ NumPy
+ Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip, the Python package manager. 
For example, to install Pandas, type the following command in your terminal or command prompt window:

`pip install pandas`

If you're using Anaconda, check whether the packages are installed in your particular environment. You can install these dependencies using the following commands:

`conda list pandas`

`conda list numpy`

`conda list matplotlib`

If a package is not installed in your environment, you can use the `conda install`.

Note that if you're using a virtual environment, you'll need to activate the environment before installing the dependencies.


### How to run the script

To run the script, open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the directory containing the `bikeshare.py` script. Then type the following command:

python bikeshare.py
